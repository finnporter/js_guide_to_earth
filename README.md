#Hitchhiker's Gide To Earth

##JavaScript Group Project Guidelines

###AIMS/PURPOSE:

- To gain experience working in a team with other developers - to understand some of the challenges this creates and ways to overcome these
- To have the opportunity to try using agile working methods
- To become more confident using Git/GitHub for a multi person project
- To consolidate learning from the JavaScript module and have the opportunity to try some new things - the project is not focused on making an exciting end product, more on the process and teamwork.
- To create a project using core Javascript - this means NO frameworks or jQuery are allowed. Only use the tools/packages we have used in class, and if you have any questions about additional tools ask an instructor.

##Brief: Educational App

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive apps that display information in a fun and interesting way.

Your task is to make an MVP to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app. You might use an API to bring in content or a database to store facts. The topic of the app is your choice, but here are some suggestions you could look into:

Interactive timeline, e.g. of the history of computer programming
Interactive map of a historical event - e.g. World War 1, the travels of Christopher Columbus
MVP

- Display some information about a particular topic in an interesting way
- Have some user interactivity using event listeners, e.g to move through different sections of content

###How to run
1) In terminal, create a folder and type ```git init``` to initialize the repo.

2) Type ```git clone``` + SSH key of the project. This downloads the repo to your machine.

3) In terminal, type ```npm install``` to download the dependencies that our project uses as detailed in the package.json file.

4) In terminal, open a tab and type ```npm run bundle``` & in another tab ```npm start```. These need to keep running in the 
background to bundle the javascript files together and run the server.

5) In Chrome, localhost:3000 will now display the project.

Note - We use a font called Anurati for our headings. It is downloadable for free here: www.mediafire.com/file/rs89wmly6evwiv8/ANURATI+Free+Font+-+ER.zip
